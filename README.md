# Sales-Prediction-with-Python
A Sales Prediction project using Python and Linear Regression to forecast product sales based on advertising spends (TV, Radio, Newspaper). Includes data analysis, visualizations, and model evaluation for actionable insights.
# Sales Prediction with Python
# 📌 Overview
This project focuses on predicting product sales using advertising data (TV, Radio, Newspaper). By applying a Linear Regression model, the project aims to analyze how advertising budgets influence sales and provide actionable insights.

# 📊 Dataset
The dataset advertising.csv includes:

TV – Advertising expenditure on TV (in thousands of dollars)

Radio – Advertising expenditure on Radio (in thousands of dollars)

Newspaper – Advertising expenditure on Newspaper (in thousands of dollars)

Sales – Units sold (in thousands)

# 🚀 Project Steps
Data Loading & Exploration – Inspecting dataset, checking statistics.

Data Visualization – Pairplots and heatmaps to understand correlations.

Feature Selection – Choosing TV, Radio, and Newspaper as predictors.

Model Building – Training a Linear Regression model.

Model Evaluation – Evaluating with MAE, RMSE, and R² score.

Prediction Visualization – Plotting actual vs predicted sales.

# 🧠 Key Insights
TV and Radio spends show a stronger correlation with sales compared to Newspaper.

Linear Regression provides a simple yet effective baseline for forecasting.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python

Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – Model building and evaluation

# 📈 Results
Achieved a high R² score demonstrating that advertising spend effectively predicts sales trends.

Visualizations reveal clear patterns between ad spends and sales.
